- Run node app.js to launch express server

- Use build.sh if need to regenerate JS
- Use make-static.sh to generate static verions
- Edit game server URL in public/javascript/server_url.js

## TODO
- Make tilespec converter, right now need original project to generate those
  - Flags
- Make handlebards pre-compilation or get rid of precompilation entirely
- Cleanup CSS. Ideally separate main website from game client entirely.
- Add tileset argument to launcher
- Add space tileset!
